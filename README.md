## Problem Statement
As students, many of us feel **lost and overwhelmed** when it comes to choosing a career. We’re told to figure it out, but rarely shown where to start. The pressure to succeed, paired with a competitive job market, makes it even harder.
My cofounder, who is an NTU undergraduate, felt this firsthand — unsure of what roles suit me or who to ask for help. That’s when the idea struck: what if we had an AI-powered career mentor that understands our personality, goals, and gives us a clear plan forward?
That’s the heart of **Career Pal** — helping students navigate their career journey with clarity, confidence, and support.

## Solution
Career Pal guides users through five simple steps:
- **Step 1: Career Discovery Test** – Users complete a short test by answering a series of questions. The responses are then analyzed.
- **Step 2: Career Recommendations** – Based on the analysis, the top 3 most suitable careers are recommended, tailored to each user's values, personality, and interests.
- **Step 3: Career Exploration** – Users explore each suggested role in detail, including job responsibilities, required skills, salary range, growth outlook, and potential trade-offs.
- **Step 4: Account Creation** – After choosing a preferred career, users create an account to receive a personalized career roadmap.
- **Step 5: Unlock Additional Features** – As users complete tasks, they unlock access to advanced features such as resume building, job search tools, mentorship, and career coaching. (Note: These some of these features are not included in the current MVP.)
